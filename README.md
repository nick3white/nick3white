# Hi, I'm Nick

## Full stack developer and librarian

On a mission to make the internet an accurate reflection of the vibrant, diverse, and amazing community that create it. 

Most of my day-to-day coding is either in private repos for my freelance work, or on GitLab.  My personal code is mostly on Source Hut.  I try to keep this account alive, but you know how these things go.
